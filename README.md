# Advanced-AI
AAI is a MCreator mod that other MCreator mods can use and possibly coded mods to set up advanced pathfinding and fatures though a simple command.
The modification uses entity NBT tags to control the movement of the entity allowing for searching for target blocks then pathfind toward the target.
