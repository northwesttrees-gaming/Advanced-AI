# Advanced-AI
AAI is a MCreator mod that other MCreator mods can use and possibly coded mods to set up advanced pathfinding and fatures though a simple command.
The modification uses entity NBT tags to control the movement of the entity allowing for searching for target blocks then pathfind toward the target.

## üìù Development and Plans
The issues tab has all open tasks we want to work on, some things are early in planing and require more details and planning in the future but we want to keep the ideas transparent and clean so people can easily find things planned so when suggesting new things under the Idea discussion it will not be for things alreay planned.
We ask that you don't report issues here instead report them on the discussions tab under the report-issue category.
