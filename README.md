# Advanced-AI
AAI is a MCreator mod that other MCreator mods can use and possibly coded mods to set up advanced pathfinding and fatures though a simple command.
The modification uses entity NBT tags to control the movement of the entity allowing for searching for target blocks then pathfind toward the target.

## Important Development Notification
I know many creators in the MCreator community really want this API for there mod and there are many questions people have for it.
I have tried my best to keep up with the questions people have and make sure that everything is stable as it can be.
I worry that people will get frusterated on the progress being to slow, I sadly can't make the development go any faster.
Making the pathfinding system is no easy task, lots of things need to be taken into consideration, and support needs to be added for many blocks like fences, doors and gates, and blocks that can deal damage, with that aside liquds are not obtainable in block form so many obsticals still need to be overcome in order to make sure the first relase is stable.

# Roadmap
With that being said there are many things I do want to add into the modification not just land support but other kinds of features below is a table in the order which I will be progressing with development.
